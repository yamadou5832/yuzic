# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** October 23, 2025  
**App name:** Yuzic  
**Developer:** Zack Starnes  

---

## 1. Overview
Yuzic is a personal music player and streaming app built with React Native.  
This policy explains how the app handles user data and permissions across all supported platforms (Android, iOS).

---

## 2. Information Collection and Use
Yuzic does **not collect, store, or share** any personal or usage information.  
All music playback occurs **entirely on your device**.  

If you connect to your own self-hosted server (such as Navidrome, Jellyfin, or similar), all communication happens **directly between your device and that server** — never through any third-party or developer-controlled service.

---

## 3. Audio Permission (Record Audio / Microphone Access)
Yuzic may request **microphone** or **“record audio”** permission because some operating systems require it for **audio playback routing**.

- The app **does not record**, **store**, **analyze**, or **transmit** any microphone input.  
- The permission is used only to **enable smooth and uninterrupted music playback**.  
- **No voice input or audio capture features** are present.

---

## 4. Third-Party Integrations
Optional integrations (for example, **Last.fm scrobbling** or connections to your own media server) may involve third-party services.  
Yuzic itself does **not share or process any personal data** beyond what is required for playback or metadata retrieval.  

You should review the **privacy policies of any third-party services** you connect to.

---

## 5. Data Security
The app does not retain or transmit personal data.  
All server connections are performed using **secure HTTPS protocols** when available.

---

## 6. Your Choices
You can revoke microphone permissions in your device settings at any time.  
The app will continue to function normally for local music playback.
