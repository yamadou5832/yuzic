## Info
Yuzic is a cross platform opensource music player for Navidrome and Jellyfin. Built with React Native.

• Switch seamlessly between Navidrome and Jellyfin
• New Text-to-Music button allows users to listen to a curated playlist for any mood
• Enriched data via Last.fm
• Download albums and playlists to listen to offline

Yuzic provides a Navidrome demo but requires a self-hosted Jellyfin or Subsonic server to function as intended.
